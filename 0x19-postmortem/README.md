My first postmortem

Issue Summary:
Duration:
 Start Time: March 6, 2024, 02:15 AM EAT
 End Time: March 6, 2024, 05:45 AM EAT
Impact:
 The outage affected our primary online banking service, leading to a complete unavailability for 30% of our users during the incident window. Users experienced inability to log in, perform transactions, and check their account balances.
Root Cause:
 The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfigured load balancer, causing an improper distribution of incoming traffic and subsequently overwhelming critical backend servers.
Timeline:
Detection Time:
 March 10, 2024, 02:15 AM UTC
Detection Method:
 Automated monitoring triggered an alert for a sudden spike in server errors.
Actions Taken:
02:20 AM UTC: Initiated an investigation into server logs and load balancer configurations.
02:45 AM UTC: Initial assumption was a potential DDoS attack due to the unusual traffic pattern.
03:30 AM UTC: Engaged the network security team to analyze potential malicious activity.
04:15 AM UTC: Realized the load balancer misconfiguration after a thorough review of server logs.
Misleading Paths:
The initial assumption of a DDoS attack led to unnecessary collaboration with the security team, diverting attention from the actual issue.
A brief exploration into recent software updates also proved to be a misleading path.
Escalation:
04:45 AM UTC: Incident escalated to the infrastructure team for immediate load balancer reconfiguration.
05:00 AM UTC: Communications team alerted for user notifications and updates.
Resolution:
05:45 AM UTC: Load balancer configuration corrected, and services gradually restored.
06:00 AM UTC: User access stabilized, and a system-wide check confirmed the resolution.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause Explanation:
 The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings resulted in uneven distribution of incoming traffic. This caused a bottleneck in certain backend servers, leading to an overload and subsequent service disruption.
Resolution Details:
 The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration. Specifically, we adjusted the load balancing algorithm to evenly distribute traffic across all backend servers. This change was thoroughly tested in a controlled environment before being applied to the production system.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Areas for Improvement/Fixes:
Load Balancer Monitoring: Enhance monitoring for load balancer performance and configurations to quickly identify anomalies.
Incident Response Training: Conduct additional training for the incident response team to improve initial diagnosis accuracy and minimize unnecessary escalations.
Communication Protocols: Strengthen communication protocols for real-time updates to users during outages.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Load Balancer Audit: Conduct a comprehensive audit of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
Incident Response Review: Review and update the incident response playbook, incorporating lessons learned from this outage.
User Communication Strategy: Develop a more robust strategy for communicating with users during service disruptions, including status updates and estimated resolution times.
